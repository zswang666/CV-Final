# Face recognition with User interface

In this project, we use [learning based model][6] to extract face features and to recognize who you are. Also, we create an elegant user interface in order to provide a good user experience. By interacting  with our UI, you can add/remove your face in our database.

## Requirements
- Python 3.5.2
- [Tensorflow][1]
- [PyQt5][2]
- [OpenCV][3] 

## Pretrained-Model

Please download FaceNet pretrained model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5MzpY9kBtDVSTgxX25ZQzNTMGc/view), extract and put it in CVFinal/pretrained_models/FaceNet/


## Usage
- <b>Run Face recognition</b> : 
```
python3 Top.py
```


- <b>Register identity face</b> :
	- Click the bounding box and type your name
	


- <b>Remove identity face</b> :
	- Choose your name on the list and click remove buttom.
