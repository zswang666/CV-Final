# CV-Final
This project, **Learning-Based Face Recognition with User Interface**, is the final project of 2016-Fall Computer Vision (EE648500) in NTHU. We use [MTCNN](https://kpzhang93.github.io/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment/) as face detector and [FaceNet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) for face recognition. Also a simple user interface is implemented to register identities in the face recognition system. For more details, please refer to the pdf file and the code.
